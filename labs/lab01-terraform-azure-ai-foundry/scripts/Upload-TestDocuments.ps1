2. Azure AI Search (formerly Azure Cognitive Search)
   - Full-text search capabilities
   - Vector search for semantic similarity
   - AI-powered content enrichment

3. Azure AI Vision
   - Image analysis and recognition
   - OCR for text extraction from images
   - Face detection and recognition

4. Azure AI Language
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Key phrase extraction
   - Named entity recognition
   - Language detection

Key Benefits:
- Easy integration with existing applications

# Azure AI Search Best Practices

## Index Design
- Plan your index schema carefully
- Use appropriate field types for your data
- Enable vector search for semantic capabilities
- Implement proper field mappings

## Performance Optimization
- Use batch operations for bulk data ingestion
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor query performance and optimize
- Use search filters to reduce result sets

## Security Considerations
- Enable RBAC for secure access control
- Use managed identities for authentication
- Implement network security restrictions
- Monitor access patterns and usage

## AI Enrichment
- Use skillsets for content processing
- Implement custom skills for specific needs
- Cache enriched content for performance
- Monitor AI service usage and costs

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- Set up proper logging and alerting
- Monitor indexer performance
- Implement change detection policies
- Regular index maintenance and optimization
