# AI Labs

Welcome to the AI Labs repository! This repository contains hands-on labs and examples for working with Azure AI services, AI Foundry, and the Microsoft AI stack.

## Overview

This repository is designed to help you learn and experiment with various Azure AI services through practical, step-by-step labs. Each lab includes complete infrastructure-as-code (Terraform) configurations and detailed instructions.

## Labs

### [Lab 01: Terraform Azure AI Foundry Environment](./labs/lab01-terraform-azure-ai-foundry/)

Learn how to provision a complete Azure AI Foundry environment using Terraform. This comprehensive lab sets up:

> ðŸ“‹ **Detailed Setup Instructions**: See the [Lab 01 README](./labs/lab01-terraform-azure-ai-foundry/README.md) for complete step-by-step deployment instructions, including Terraform configuration and required manual setup steps.

**Core AI Services:**

- Azure AI Foundry Hub and Project with system-assigned managed identities
- Azure OpenAI service with GPT-4o and text-embedding-3-large deployments
- Azure AI Search with RBAC authentication and vector search capabilities
- Azure Storage with secure blob containers for documents and logs

**Security & Access:**

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all services
- Managed Identity authentication (no API keys)
- Proper role assignments for service-to-service communication
- Secure storage account with disabled shared key access

**Advanced Features:**

- Azure AI Search indexing configuration for blob storage import
- Vector search capabilities with embedding integration
- Document processing and AI enrichment pipelines
- Helper scripts for data upload and search configuration

**Technologies**: Terraform, Azure AI Foundry, Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, PowerShell, Bash
