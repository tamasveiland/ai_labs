Additionally, implement content filtering, adjust temperature settings for more consistent outputs, and use techniques like chain-of-thought prompting for complex reasoning tasks.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"Improve response quality through prompt engineering, RAG implementation, fine-tuning, systematic evaluation with quality metrics, search optimization, content filtering, temperature adjustment, and advanced techniques like chain-of-thought prompting.\\\"}\"}]", "outputs.similarity.similarity_sample_output": "[{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"5\"}]", "outputs.response_length.response_length_chars": 758, "outputs.response_length.response_length_words": 96, "outputs.response_length.response_length_within_range": true, "outputs.response_length.response_length_score": 5.0}], "metrics": {"groundedness.groundedness": 3.8, "groundedness.gpt_groundedness": 3.8, "groundedness.groundedness_threshold": 3.0, "relevance.relevance": 5.0, "relevance.gpt_relevance": 5.0, "relevance.relevance_threshold": 3.0, "coherence.coherence": 4.2, "coherence.gpt_coherence": 4.2, "coherence.coherence_threshold": 3.0, "fluency.fluency": 4.0, "fluency.gpt_fluency": 4.0, "fluency.fluency_threshold": 3.0, "similarity.similarity": 5.0, "similarity.gpt_similarity": 5.0, "similarity.similarity_threshold": 3.0, "response_length.response_length_chars": 674.2, "response_length.response_length_words": 91.2, "response_length.response_length_within_range": 1.0, "response_length.response_length_score": 5.0, "groundedness.binary_aggregate": 0.8, "relevance.binary_aggregate": 1.0, "coherence.binary_aggregate": 1.0, "fluency.binary_aggregate": 1.0, "similarity.binary_aggregate": 1.0}, "studio_url": null}
